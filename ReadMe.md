Project: Pi Hosting

The purpose of this project is to build my personal website and learn how to configure a Raspberry Pi
as a $35 webserver. As of 4/12/17, I have redone much of my personal site using HTML and CSS. I have also purchased my
own domain name at brettswan.info. My objective for 4/15/17 is to figure out the setup of the DNS servers so that entering
my domain name will route the request to my home network. After that I need to configure my router and Raspberry Pi to respond
to HTML requests.
